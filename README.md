Docker management package with higher-level functions

# higher-docker-manager

HigherDockerManager is built on top of [node-docker-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-docker-api) offering some higher-order management [functions](#features). `node-docker-api` is not included as dependency but referenced as a peer dependency.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save higher-docker-manager node-docker-api@^1.1.2
```

## Usage

```js
const HigherDockerManager = require('higher-docker-manager');

return HigherDockerManager.pullImage({}, 'hello-world:latest')
    .then(() => HigherDockerManager.runTemporaryContainer({
        image: 'hello-world:latest'
    }))
    .then((output) => {
        assert(_.isArray(output));
        assert(output[1].payload, 'Hello from Docker!\n');
    });
```

## Features

* Pulling an image from a repository
* Finding process's own container if its running in Docker
* Running a temporary container
* Executing a command in a running container
* Finding containers by networks, labels and images
* Finding volumes by labels and their values
* Finding networks by labels and their values

## API

HigherDockerManager class offers functions to manage docker images, volumes and containers.

* `returns` **{Container}**: Found container if it was found, otherwise `null`.  

Finds the object with the given name or ID in the given collection. Note that this
function doesn't work for containers as they can have more than one name. Use
`findContainerForNameOrId` for containers.

**Params**
